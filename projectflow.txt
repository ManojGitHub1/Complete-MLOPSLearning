Building Pipeline:
1. add experiments folder (general DS workflow)
2. add src folder along with all components/artifacts(run then individually)
3. add data, models, reports directories to .gitignore file
4. git commit-push


Setting up DVC pipeline (without params):
5. Create dvc.yaml file and add stages to it.
6. dvc init then do "dvc repro" to test the pipeline automation. (use/check "dvc dag" to check graph visually dag(directed acyclic graph))
7. now git add, commit, push
